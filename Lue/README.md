# Lue X Nuxt
- Made a fun and quick site to test out and learn more about the Nuxt environment

## Tools:
Here are the tools I used:
- ![Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com)
- ![Tailwind Css](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- ![Icons](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/icon)

## After Thoughts:
It was very fun making this one. At first it was very confusing considering Nuxt 3 is new and stuff, but hey i made it!! 
Nuxt is a very intriging framework and i am all for it!
